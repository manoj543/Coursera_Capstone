By using these venues for the neighbourhoods we can apply one hot encoding and build a metric of comparison based on the category types of each venue.\n",

    "3. Now we have merged both cities neighbourhoods.\n",
    "4. The metric which we are going to use for comparing different neighbourhoods is the venue category metric along the neighbourhood's row.\n",
    "5. We can find out what are the neighbourhoods in New York(Manhattan) which are similar to the neighbourhoods in Toronto and vice versa.\n",
    "6. The similarity can be calculated using the category metric of each neighbourhood.\n",
    "7. The machine learning algorithm which is best suitable for our situation is k-means clustering.\n",
    "8. We are going to apply the k-means clustering using **toronto_manhattan_grouped** dataframe as the input data and group all the neighbourhoods.\n",
    "9. What is the best value of k we need to use for the k-means clustering. We are going to decide it using elbow method.\n",
    "10. By choosing the optimal value of k, we train the model and visualize all the neighbourhoods grouped based on cluster labels on the folium Map object.\n",
    "11. We can list out all the neighbourhoods in each cluster for a clear picture."
